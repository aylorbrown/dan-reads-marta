        MARTA is the main public transit operator in metropolitan Atlanta. Like any public transit, it’s an integral part of the community, providing meaningful mobility to those who have no other transportation options and an attractive alternative to the car for all residents and visitors. About two-thirds of MARTA riders have cars available to them but they choose to ride MARTA.

        Determined to continue our car-free lifestyle after moving from Philadelphia, my partner, Dan, and I easily chose MARTA as our main transportation. Admittedly, it has taken money and creativity to be able to live car-free in a city built around the car. (If you’re interested in how urban renewal projects of the 1950s destroyed communities and created isolated, unnatural urban spaces, read “The Life and Death of Great American Cities” by Jane Jacobs.)

        How we choose to move influences the shape of our lives, as well as the quality of our neighborhoods and cities. Dan and I find it hard to make time for reading in our busy lives, but a daily MARTA commute changed that. As his commute got longer, his reading list got longer too. Dan Reads Marta is a collection of all the books Dan has started and finished on his MARTA commute. If he drove to work like most Atlantans, that time would have been lost to sitting in traffic. This site represents the burning of a little less fossil fuels and the making of a more active and informed citizen. Thanks, Dan!
